# Combating-Forgery-of-Signs
This repository consists of 2 ML(specifically Computer Vision) projects that can detect forged signatures. 
The first project trains an SVM model by extracting HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) features from training data. An accuracy of 94.7% was achieved.
The 2nd project involves transferring stylistic features from artistic images using NST(Neural Style Transfer) to create forged signatures. The model above was then used to make predictions and an accuracy of 100% was achieved. A highly simplified version has been provided here, transferring styles from only 5 images to 6 signatures.
